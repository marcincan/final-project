<h2>Orientation: Course Materials</h2>
COMP 1950 homework assignments, quizzes, in class exercises and example code can be accessed via Desire 2 Learn (D2L).
Use your BCIT student number and password to access D2L. Course materials will become avilable as the course
progresses. It is your responsibility to log in and download files as they become available.
If you have difficulty gaining access, consult the D2L help documentation, or contact BCIT Tech help desk at
604-412-7444 (Toll free: 1-800-351-5533).
Orientation: Web space
Each student will get a personal webspace where you will publish your homework assignments. This is not a continuation
of your COMP1850 site (if you had one). This site is primarily for you to house your exercises, assignments and group
work. Make it a site that is usable and functional.
• Your instructor will create webspaces for each of you.
• Email your instructor this information:
o your myBCIT email - eg: yourname123@my.BCIT.ca
o your student number - eg: A00123456
o a case sensitive password you will remember - ???
• Take the name portion of your my.bcit.ca email address and use it at the end of the URL described below (eg: if your
email address is 'yourname123@my.bcit.ca', your email name is 'yourname123', so your url would be
'http://bcitcomp.ca/students/yourname123'
For example: http://bcitcomp.ca/students/your_bcit_email_name
Connect to your bcitcomp.ca account via FTP
Use Filezilla, or any FTP client to connect to bcitcomp.ca. The bcitcomp.ca server provides you with a space on the
internet where you can publish your homework and assignments.
1. Choose: File->SiteManager->New Site, then describe the FTP server, eg "bcitcomp.ca"
2. Host: bcitcomp.ca
3. Port: 21
4. User: {yourBCITStudentNumber}@bcitcomp.ca (use an uppercase A when typing your BCIT student number)
5. Password: ???
6. Servertype: FTP File Transfer Protocol
7. LogonType: Normal
8. Click: Connect
9. If you experience connectivity problems, re-check your input, or ask your instructor for assistance.

    control for managing your code, and web-based fonts for professional typography.
